While there exist many similar ODE progress bar and interrupt, there is yet program that has been proposed to be used with app designer architecture.
The program was inspired by the work of [Tim Franklin](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/9904-ode-progress-bar-and-interrupt).As such, most of the features are similar.


Compare to the work of Tim Franklin, all codes are package under class defination. Both the progress bar and abort button can be arranged freely on the uifigure workspace. The cancel button prematurely exits the integration while retaining the data up to the point of termination.
An example implementation is included with the program (main.m)
